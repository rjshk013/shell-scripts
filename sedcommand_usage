Sample Commands

    Replacing or substituting string : Sed command is mostly used to replace the text in a file. The below simple sed command replaces the word “unix” with “linux” in the file.

    $sed 's/unix/linux/' geekfile.txt

    Output :


    linux is great os. unix is opensource. unix is free os.
    learn operating system.
    linux linux which one you choose.
    linux is easy to learn.unix is a multiuser os.Learn unix .unix is a powerful.

    Here the “s” specifies the substitution operation. The “/” are delimiters. The “unix” is the search pattern and the “linux” is the replacement string.

    By default, the sed command replaces the first occurrence of the pattern in each line and it won’t replace the second, third…occurrence in the line.
    Replacing the nth occurrence of a pattern in a line : Use the /1, /2 etc flags to replace the first, second occurrence of a pattern in a line. The below command replaces the second occurrence of the word “unix” with “linux” in a line.

    $sed 's/unix/linux/2' geekfile.txt

    Output:

    unix is great os. linux is opensource. unix is free os.
    learn operating system.
    unix linux which one you choose.
    unix is easy to learn.linux is a multiuser os.Learn unix .unix is a powerful.

    Replacing all the occurrence of the pattern in a line : The substitute flag /g (global replacement) specifies the sed command to replace all the occurrences of the string in the line.

    $sed 's/unix/linux/g' geekfile.txt

    Output :

    linux is great os. linux is opensource. linux is free os.
    learn operating system.
    linux linux which one you choose.
    linux is easy to learn.linux is a multiuser os.Learn linux .linux is a powerful.
    
    Replacing string on a specific line number : You can restrict the sed command to replace the string on a specific line number. An example is

$sed '3 s/unix/linux/' geekfile.txt

Output:

unix is great os. unix is opensource. unix is free os.
learn operating system.
linux linux which one you choose.
unix is easy to learn.unix is a multiuser os.Learn unix .unix is a powerful.

The above sed command replaces the string only on the third line. 

Deleting lines from a particular file : SED command can also be used for deleting lines from a particular file. SED command is used for performing deletion operation without even opening the file
Examples:
1. To Delete a particular line say n in this example

Syntax:
$ sed 'nd' filename.txt
Example:
$ sed '5d' filename.txt

2. To Delete a last line

Syntax:
$ sed '$d' filename.txt

Delete the pattern matching line –
Syntax: sed ‘/pattern/d’ filename

Example :

[root@rhel7 ~]# sed '/life/d' a.txt
